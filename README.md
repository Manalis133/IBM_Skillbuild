# Sentiment Analysis of Restaurant Reviews

## Overview

This project performs sentiment analysis on restaurant reviews to classify them as either positive or negative. It leverages natural language processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning algorithms to automate the sentiment analysis process. The project provides valuable insights into customer sentiments, aiding restaurant owners and managers in making data-driven decisions to enhance customer satisfaction.

## Features

- **Multi-Algorithm Approach:** Utilizes three classification algorithms (Multinomial Naive Bayes, Bernoulli Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression) for flexibility and comparison.
  
- **Comprehensive Evaluation:** Offers accuracy, precision, and recall metrics for thorough model assessment.
  
- **Data Visualization:** Includes visualizations using Matplotlib and Seaborn for sentiment distribution and model performance understanding.
  
- **User-Friendly Documentation:** Provides step-by-step explanations and context throughout the project for ease of understanding.
  
- **Customizable and Adaptable:** Easily adaptable to different datasets and use cases, allowing users to tailor the analysis.
  
- **Value Proposition:** Emphasizes how the solution meets end users' needs, including automated analysis, data-driven insights, and decision support.

## Results

The project achieved the following results for sentiment classification:

- Multinomial Naive Bayes: Accuracy - 77.67%, Precision - 0.78, Recall - 0.77.
- Bernoulli Naive Bayes: Accuracy - 77.0%, Precision - 0.76, Recall - 0.78.
- Logistic Regression: Accuracy - 76.67%, Precision - 0.8, Recall - 0.71.

These results demonstrate the effectiveness of the project in automating sentiment analysis and providing valuable insights.
